# Drone Delivery System

- Overview:
  - The purpose of this project was to see if a drone could deliver a package to a customer in an online simulation based at the University of Minnesota campus.
  
- Features:
  - Drone movement is realistic: acceleration, force, maximum speed, etc.
  - Several different types of drones varying in weight, battery capacity, maximum speed, etc.
  - Uses Djikstra's shortest path to calculate efficient routes for the drone to the package and the drone to the customer.
  - Observers are used to notify the user of the process of the drone: delivering, idle, delivered package, etc.
  - Drone battery drains as the simulation progresses. If the battery runs out, a recharge drone will come, recharge the drone to maximum capacity, and the original drone will continue the delivery.
  - Regression, unit, and integration tests created to verify correctness.
